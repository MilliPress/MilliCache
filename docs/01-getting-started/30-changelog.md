# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-02-13)

Initial stable release of MilliCache — a full-page cache plugin for WordPress powered by Redis compatible servers.

### Highlights

* **In-Memory Full-Page Cache** — Pages are served directly from memory before WordPress even initializes. No database queries.
* **Flag-Based Invalidation** — Tag cached pages with flags like `post:123` or `archive:category:5`, then clear related entries with a single command. Built-in flags are assigned automatically; custom flags give you full control.
* **Stale-While-Revalidate** — Serve expired content while fresh content regenerates in the background. Prevents cache stampedes on high-traffic pages.
* **Rules Engine** — Define caching behavior with a fluent, chainable PHP API. Set TTL, grace periods, and exclusions per condition — all version-controllable.
* **Multisite Native** — Per-site cache isolation with network-wide management. Clear one site, a subset, or an entire network.
* **Multiple Backends** — Redis, ValKey, KeyDB, or Dragonfly. Any Redis-compatible server works out of the box.
* **WP-CLI Integration** — Commands for cache testing, status checks, diagnostics, and bulk operations. AI-agent friendly.
* **Debug Headers & Browser Extension** — `X-MilliCache-*` headers show cache status, flags, and keys. The companion browser extension makes debugging effortless.
* **REST API** — `/millicache/v1/*` endpoints for cache control, status checks, and settings — ideal for CI/CD pipelines and monitoring.
* **Action & Filter Hooks** — Full customization of caching behavior, flag assignment, and invalidation events.
* **Smart Auto-Invalidation** — Cache clears automatically when posts, menus, widgets, or theme settings change.
* **Open Source** — GPL-2.0+ licensed. No vendor lock-in.
